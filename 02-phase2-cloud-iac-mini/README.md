# Phase 2 Mini Project – Cloud Infrastructure Automation

## Aim
The aim of this mini project was to demonstrate the use of Infrastructure as Code to provision cloud infrastructure automatically, replacing manual resource creation in AWS.

## Description
A CloudFormation template was created to define and deploy an EC2 instance and associated security group. The infrastructure was provisioned through AWS CloudFormation, allowing resources to be created, verified, and removed in a controlled and repeatable manner.

## Infrastructure Defined
- EC2 instance (Ubuntu Linux)
- Security Group allowing SSH access
- Output of public IP address for verification

## Evidence
Screenshots in the `evidence/screenshots` directory demonstrate:
- Successful CloudFormation stack creation
- EC2 instance deployment
- Stack outputs confirming resource creation

## Learning Outcomes
This mini project supports Learning Outcomes LO3 and LO4 by demonstrating understanding and application of cloud infrastructure concepts, Infrastructure as Code, and secure resource provisioning.
