Phase 3 Mini Project – Containerisation, CI/CD, and Monitoring
Overview

This mini project focuses on containerisation, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and basic monitoring using cloud-based infrastructure. The aim is to demonstrate how DevOps pipelines reduce manual deployment effort and improve reliability.

What Was Implemented

A small Node.js application containerised using Docker

A Jenkins pipeline to automatically build and deploy the container from GitHub

Deployment to an AWS EC2 instance using Docker

Prometheus configured to monitor basic system and application metrics

Evidence

Successful Jenkins pipeline execution

Running Docker containers on the EC2 instance

Live application accessible via the EC2 public IP

Prometheus monitoring interface confirming metrics collection

All configuration files, scripts, and screenshots are stored in this repository.

Learning Outcomes

This project supports:

LO3 – Systematic understanding of CI/CD and containerisation

LO4 – Application of digital technology methods in deployment automation

LO5 – Evaluation of system behaviour through monitoring

KSBs evidenced include K26, S5, and S19.
