# Phase 1 Mini Project Linux Automation Foundations

## Aim
The aim of this mini project was to demonstrate foundational DevOps principles by automating common Linux server setup tasks, replacing manual configuration with a repeatable script-based approach.

## Description
A Bash script was created to automate initial system configuration on an Ubuntu Linux server. The script updates the system, installs core tools required for later DevOps phases, configures Docker as a service, and prepares a standard directory structure for application deployment and logging.

## Key Automation Tasks
- Automated system update and upgrade
- Installation of Git, Curl, and Docker
- Enabling and starting Docker as a system service
- Creation of standard deployment directories with correct permissions
- Verification of installed tools and services

## Evidence
Screenshots located in the `evidence/screenshots` directory demonstrate:
- Successful execution of the automation script
- Docker running as an active service
- Creation of deployment directories
- Verification of installed tools

## Learning Outcomes
This mini project supports Learning Outcomes LO1 and LO3 by demonstrating understanding of DevOps automation concepts, Linux system administration, and the ability to apply theoretical knowledge through practical automation.
